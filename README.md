# Disclaimer!
Attention! This extension works only with ULauncher v4. 
Someone needs to fork this repo, then upgrade the extension (to Python 3), so it will work with ULauncher v5. 

Corresponding issues are opened and could be found in the issues list. Unfortunately, due to my schedule, I am unable to do it by myself, so I would be glad to anyone, who would do it for ULauncher :)

# In two words
Simple translator for https://ulauncher.io/ using translate-shell

# Dependencies

You have to install [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell). Also it should be in your `$PATH` (Copy executeable to /bin/ for example)
